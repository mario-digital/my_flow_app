# My Flow - Project Overview

## üéØ Core Concept

**My Flow** reimagines the traditional TODO app by recognizing that we're all "digital nomads" - not traveling across countries, but constantly moving across _contexts_ throughout our day. Morning-you, work-you, weekend-you, and social-you each have different needs, priorities, and habits.

Instead of managing tasks, **My Flow** helps you manage _transitions_ between these different versions of yourself, using AI as an intelligent companion that learns your patterns and helps you show up intentionally in each context.

---

## üåü Why This Matters

**Most productivity apps focus on doing more. My Flow focuses on being more intentional.**

By helping people:

- Manage their transitions between contexts
- Recognize patterns in how they show up
- Reduce overwhelm through context-aware filtering
- Build self-awareness about their natural rhythms

**My Flow** transforms the "boring TODO app" into a flow companion that supports healthier rhythms of work and life.

---

## üë• Who It's For

Anyone who feels pulled in multiple directions daily:

- Students balancing classes, work, and personal life
- Professionals shifting between deep work, meetings, and family
- Creatives managing bursts of energy with downtime
- Anyone who struggles with context-switching and wants more intentional transitions

---

## üß© Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Context Modes

Users operate in 3-4 primary contexts:

- **Work Flow** - Professional, career, productivity
- **Personal Flow** - Family, errands, self-care
- **Rest Flow** - Relaxation, recovery, downtime
- **Social Flow** (optional) - Friendships, community, events

Each context is a "frame of self" - a distinct mode with its own priorities and energy.

### 2. AI Conversation Interface

**The AI is the primary entry point for interaction.**

**What it does:**

- Natural language conversation about what's on your mind
- Interprets user input and creates "flows" (tasks under the hood)
- Helps users identify or confirm their current context
- Learns patterns over time to provide personalized suggestions

**Example Interaction:**

```
User: "I need to finish my project presentation"
AI: "Got it. I'll add that to your Work Flow. When do you need it done by?"
User: "Friday"
AI: "Added 'Finish project presentation' to Work Flow, due Friday.
     I see you have a meeting Thursday afternoon - want to schedule prep time before that?"
```

**Chat Architecture:**

- Session-based UI (focuses on the present moment)
- Full history stored in MongoDB for context and learning
- AI references past conversations to build understanding of user patterns

### 3. Context View (Not Task View)

**Each context shows only 3-5 relevant flows** - no overwhelming master lists.

**Work Flow might show:**

- Finish slides
- Email client
- Prep meeting

**Personal Flow might show:**

- Call mom
- Plan dinner
- Schedule doctor appointment

**Key Principle:** Intentional scarcity. By limiting what's visible, users focus on what truly matters in that context.

**User Preference:**

- AI asks: "Show all flows or just incomplete?"
- User choice becomes their default
- Recently completed flows can be shown for sense of progress

### 4. Context Data Panel

**When entering a context, users see relevant information:**

üìÖ **Upcoming Events**

- Next 2-3 meetings with time and title
- Appointments or deadlines

üìß **Important Communications**

- Flagged emails with sender and subject
- Messages requiring attention

‚ö° **Quick Stats**

- "3 flows due today"
- "2 meetings in next 4 hours"

**For MVP:** This is dummy/mock data generated at signup and stored in MongoDB. Future versions will integrate with Google Calendar, Gmail, Slack, etc. via MCP or similar integrations.

### 5. Transition Moments (The Magic)

**This is the killer feature that differentiates My Flow from typical TODO apps.**

When switching contexts, the AI facilitates reflection and intention-setting:

**Entering a Context:**

```
AI: "Welcome to Work Flow. I see you have a meeting with Sarah in 2 hours. Want to prep for it?"
AI: "Your wife emailed about the kids' school event. Want to handle that now or save it for Personal Flow?"
AI: "You have 3 incomplete flows from yesterday. Should we prioritize those or start fresh?"
```

**Exiting a Context:**

```
AI: "How did Work Flow go today?"
User: "Productive, but I'm tired"
AI: "Ready to switch to Rest Flow? I can help you wind down."
```

**The AI is proactive and contextual:**

- Recognizes cross-context items (personal email during Work Flow)
- Suggests flow creation based on upcoming events
- Respects boundaries (doesn't nag)
- Learns preferences over time

### 6. Flow Management

**"Flows" replace "tasks" - the terminology shift matters.**

**AI is the primary creator:**

- Most flows emerge from conversation with AI
- AI extracts intentions and converts them to actionable flows
- AI suggests consolidation or editing

**Users have basic CRUD:**

- ‚úÖ Mark complete
- ‚úÖ Edit text
- ‚úÖ Delete
- ‚úÖ Move between contexts (maybe)

**Database Structure (Tasks renamed as Flows):**

```javascript
flows: {
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId,
  content: String,
  context: "work" | "personal" | "rest" | "social",
  status: "incomplete" | "complete",
  dueDate: Date (optional),
  createdBy: "ai" | "user",
  createdAt: Date,
  completedAt: Date (optional),
  labels: [String] // for future categorization
}
```

---

## üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è User Journey (MVP)

### 1. Sign Up & Onboarding

- User creates account with email/password
- AI introduces itself and asks about user's typical day
- AI suggests 3-4 default contexts (Work, Personal, Rest, optionally Social/Creative)
- Mock data generated: fake meetings, emails, appointments stored in MongoDB
- AI has initial conversation to capture a few intentions per context

### 2. Daily Use

**Morning:**

- User opens app
- AI greets: "Good morning! Ready to start your day? Which flow do you want to begin with?"
- User selects Work Flow
- AI shows context panel with meetings/emails
- AI prompts: "I see you have a 10am meeting. Want to prep?"
- User has conversation with AI, flows are created

**Midday:**

- User manually switches to Personal Flow (clicks "Switch Context")
- AI asks: "How did Work Flow go?"
- AI shows Personal context: errands, family tasks
- AI: "You have a doctor's appointment that needs scheduling. Add that as a flow?"

**Evening:**

- User switches to Rest Flow
- AI: "You've had a productive day. Time to unwind?"
- Shows minimal flows, encourages recovery

**Throughout Day:**

- Chat interface always accessible
- User can ask AI questions, add flows conversationally
- AI learns patterns: "You usually switch to Rest Flow around 7pm"

### 3. End of Day/Week Reflection

**Daily:**

```
AI: "You spent most of today in Work Flow. Feeling balanced?"
AI: "You completed 5 flows today. Nice work!"
```

**Weekly:**

```
AI: "This week you rarely entered Rest Flow. Want to prioritize that next week?"
AI: "You mentioned stress 3 times this week. Want to talk about it?"
```

## ü§ñ AI Agent Behavior

### Core Responsibilities

**1. Context Intelligence**

- Recognizes when items belong in different contexts
- Suggests context switches at appropriate times
- Respects user's current context boundaries

**2. Proactive Assistance**

- Scans context data (meetings, emails, pending items)
- Surfaces relevant information at the right moment
- Suggests flow creation based on upcoming events

**3. Pattern Learning**

- Tracks when user typically switches contexts
- Learns which types of tasks user completes/ignores
- Adapts tone and suggestions based on user responses

**4. Conversation Management**

- Extracts actionable flows from natural language
- Asks clarifying questions when needed
- Provides reflection prompts during transitions

### Example AI Prompts

**Entering Work Flow:**

- "Welcome to Work Flow. I see you have a meeting with Sarah in 2 hours. Want to prep for it?"
- "Your wife emailed about the kids' school event. That's Personal Flow territory. Want to switch or handle it later?"
- "You usually start Work Flow with admin tasks. Want me to pull those up?"

**During Work Flow:**

- "You've been in deep work for 90 minutes. Time for a break?"
- "That meeting got rescheduled to tomorrow. Want to adjust your flows?"
- "You mentioned this project is stressing you out. Want to break it into smaller flows?"

**Exiting Work Flow:**

- "How did Work Flow go today?"
- "You completed 4 of 5 flows. The incomplete one - push to tomorrow or let it go?"
- "Ready to switch to Personal Flow? I see you have some errands queued up."

**Cross-Context Awareness:**

- "This looks like a Personal Flow item, but you're in Work mode. Should I save it for later?"
- "You've been in Work Flow for 6 hours straight. Your Rest Flow is looking neglected - want to take a break?"

## üéØ The Big Picture Goal

**To create not just another task manager, but a flow companion** - an app that helps people live with more clarity, presence, and alignment in a world where we're constantly switching roles and juggling competing demands.

**The transformation:**

- From: Overwhelming task lists that make you feel behind
- To: Contextual guidance that helps you show up intentionally

**The insight:**

- We don't need to do more tasks
- We need to be more intentional about which version of ourselves we're being

**The magic:**

- AI that notices transitions and helps you reflect
- Not just "what needs to be done" but "who do you want to be right now?"

## üí° Key Differentiators

### What Makes My Flow Different

**1. Context-First, Not Task-First**

- Traditional apps: "Here are all your tasks"
- My Flow: "Here's what matters in this context"

**2. Transition Intelligence**

- Traditional apps: Silent background operation
- My Flow: Active facilitation of context switches

**3. AI as Companion, Not Tool**

- Traditional apps: AI is a feature (summarize, suggest)
- My Flow: AI is the primary interface and intelligence layer

**4. Intentional Scarcity**

- Traditional apps: Show everything, organize with filters
- My Flow: Show 3-5 things, hide the rest intentionally

**5. Reflection Over Completion**

- Traditional apps: Gamify task completion
- My Flow: Encourage self-awareness and intentionality

---

## üéì Course Requirement Alignment

**How My Flow Satisfies the Assignment:**

‚úÖ **Full-stack application** - FastAPI backend + Next.js frontend
‚úÖ **User authentication** - Email/password with JWT
‚úÖ **RESTful API** - Proper REST endpoints with FastAPI
‚úÖ **MongoDB data persistence** - All data stored in MongoDB
‚úÖ **Tasks** - Flows are tasks with enhanced UX
