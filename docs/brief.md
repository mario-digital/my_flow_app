# Project Brief: My Flow

---

## Executive Summary

**My Flow** is an AI-powered context-switching companion that reimagines productivity by helping users transition intentionally between different versions of themselves throughout the day—Work-You, Personal-You, Rest-You, and Social-You. Instead of managing overwhelming task lists, My Flow focuses on being present in each context by showing only 3-5 relevant "flows" (tasks) per context, guided by conversational AI that learns patterns and facilitates meaningful transitions.

The product targets anyone juggling multiple roles—students, professionals, creatives—who experience context-switching fatigue and want to show up more intentionally in each moment. By transforming the traditional TODO app into a flow companion with transition intelligence, My Flow delivers productivity for people tired of productivity apps.

**Target market:** Digital nomads (context-switchers), knowledge workers, students, and multi-role professionals seeking intentional living over task completion.

**Key value proposition:** Less overwhelm, more presence—through context-aware filtering, AI-guided transitions, and intentional scarcity that focuses attention on what truly matters right now.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State

Modern life demands constant context switching, yet our minds and tools aren't designed for it. Throughout a single day, people shift between fundamentally different versions of themselves—the focused professional in a morning meeting, the caring family member at lunch, the creative problem-solver in the afternoon, the depleted human needing rest in the evening. Each transition carries cognitive load, emotional recalibration, and the mental overhead of re-prioritizing what matters.

### Pain Points

- **Overwhelming master lists:** Traditional productivity apps present everything at once, forcing users to mentally filter hundreds of items to find what's relevant *right now*
- **Context-switching fatigue:** Every role change requires re-scanning an entire task list, increasing decision fatigue and reducing presence
- **No transition support:** Apps treat context switches as invisible, missing the critical moments where intention-setting matters most
- **Doing more, not being better:** Productivity tools gamify completion rather than supporting intentional living across life's different domains

### Impact (Quantified)

- Research shows context switching can reduce productivity by up to 40% and increase mental fatigue
- Knowledge workers switch contexts every 3-10 minutes on average
- 80% of tasks in typical TODO apps become stale or irrelevant, creating guilt and anxiety
- Users report feeling "behind" rather than "in flow" when using traditional task managers

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Traditional TODO apps** (Todoist, Things): Context-blind; rely on manual tagging/filtering; no transition intelligence
- **AI scheduling tools** (Motion, Reclaim): Focus on calendar optimization, not emotional/cognitive state management
- **Daily planners** (Sunsama): Better at intentional planning but still task-centric, not context-aware
- **None address the transition moment:** The critical psychological shift between contexts is completely ignored

### Urgency

Remote and hybrid work have intensified context switching (work-home boundaries blurred). Mental health awareness is rising, with users seeking tools that reduce overwhelm rather than add to it. AI capabilities now make conversational, context-aware assistance feasible at scale. The market is ready for productivity tools that prioritize wellbeing and intentionality.

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

My Flow is an AI-powered context-switching companion that helps users manage transitions between different versions of themselves throughout the day. Instead of presenting an overwhelming master task list, My Flow organizes life into 3-4 distinct "contexts" (Work Flow, Personal Flow, Rest Flow, Social Flow), each showing only 3-5 relevant items. The AI serves as the primary interface—users have natural conversations about what's on their mind, and the AI translates intentions into actionable "flows" while facilitating reflection at transition moments.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Context-First, Not Task-First:** The app adapts to *who you are right now* rather than showing everything you need to do eventually
2. **Transition Intelligence:** AI actively facilitates context switches with reflection prompts ("How did Work Flow go? Ready for Personal Flow?")
3. **AI as Companion, Not Tool:** Conversational interface is the front door; the AI learns patterns, suggests context switches, and surfaces relevant information proactively
4. **Intentional Scarcity:** Limiting visible items (3-5 per context) reduces anxiety and increases focus on what truly matters
5. **Flow-Based Language:** Reframes "tasks" as "flows"—terminology that emphasizes momentum and state rather than obligation

### Why This Solution Succeeds Where Others Haven't

- **Addresses the ignored moment:** Other apps focus on task management; we focus on the psychological transition between contexts
- **Reduces rather than adds:** Traditional apps add features/complexity; we remove cognitive load through intelligent filtering
- **AI with purpose:** Not just "AI summarization" as a feature—AI is the core interaction model that makes context awareness possible
- **Meets users where they are:** Natural language conversation vs. structured data entry
- **Balances structure and fluidity:** Predefined contexts provide scaffolding while AI conversation allows organic expression

### High-Level Product Vision

My Flow becomes the operating system for intentional living—a companion that recognizes when you're shifting modes, helps you leave one context cleanly, and enter the next with clarity. Over time, it learns your rhythms (you usually switch to Rest Flow around 7pm) and gently suggests better balance (you've been in Work Flow 80% of this week). The vision extends beyond task management to life management—helping people show up as their best selves in each moment rather than grinding through lists.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **User Authentication & Profiles:** Email/password signup and login via **Logto** (OAuth 2.1, OIDC) with secure session management. Basic user profile with name, email, and preference storage (default context, show/hide completed flows). Eliminates need for custom password hashing implementation.

- **Predefined Contexts (3-4):** Work Flow, Personal Flow, Rest Flow, and optionally Social Flow. Users can manually switch between contexts via clean UI. Each context has its own icon, display name, and isolated flow view.

- **AI Conversational Interface:** Chat-based primary interaction where users express intentions in natural language. AI extracts actionable items, creates flows, asks clarifying questions (due dates, priority), and maintains conversation history for learning. Powered by OpenAI or Anthropic Claude API with prompt engineering for context-aware responses.

- **Flow Management (Tasks Backend):** Full CRUD operations for flows (create, read, update, delete, mark complete/incomplete). Flows are tagged to specific contexts and include optional due dates, priority (AI-assigned), and creation source (AI vs. user). Database stores flows, linked to conversations that created them.

- **Context-Specific Views:** Each context displays only 3-5 most relevant flows (intentional scarcity). User preference to show "incomplete only" or "all flows" with recently completed visible for sense of progress. Clean, uncluttered UI that emphasizes current context.

- **Transition Facilitation (The Magic):** When entering a context, AI provides contextual greeting and suggests relevant actions ("I see you have a meeting in 2 hours, want to prep?"). When exiting, AI prompts brief reflection ("How did Work Flow go?"). AI recognizes cross-context items and suggests appropriate context placement.

- **Mock Context Data Panel:** Generated at signup and stored in MongoDB: fake calendar events (meetings with times/participants), fake emails (sender/subject/actionable flags), and fake pending items (appointments needing scheduling). Displayed when entering contexts to simulate future real integrations.

- **Conversation History & Memory:** Full conversation logs stored in MongoDB. AI references past interactions to build understanding of user patterns and preferences. Session-based UI (focused on present) with historical context powering AI intelligence.

- Multi-factor authentication ready

**Implementation Approach:**
- Logto handles all auth UI (sign-up, login, password reset) via hosted pages
- Frontend uses Logto Next.js SDK for session management and protected routes
- Backend validates Logto JWT tokens on protected API endpoints
- User profile data stored in both Logto (auth) and MongoDB (app-specific data)
- Seamless integration with existing Next.js 15 App Router patterns

**Security Benefits:**
- No need to implement custom password hashing (Argon2id) - handled by Logto
- Token rotation and secure session management out of the box
- Automatic security updates and patches from Logto team
- Reduces attack surface by delegating auth to specialized service

---

### Architecture Considerations

**Repository Structure:**
- Root-level project with two main directories:
  - `/my_flow_api` - FastAPI backend
  - `/my_flow_client` - Next.js 15 frontend
- Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend (generated from Pydantic v2)
- Separate `bun.lockb` (frontend) and `poetry.lock` or `uv.lock` (backend) for dependency management
- Root-level documentation, configuration files, and Docker compose for local development

**Service Architecture:**
- RESTful API design with clear endpoint structure (`/auth`, `/contexts`, `/flows`, `/chat`)
- AI Service abstraction layer (allows swapping OpenAI GPT-4 ↔ Claude 3.5 without changing core logic)
- Repository pattern for data access (clean separation between business logic and database)
- Middleware for authentication, logging, error handling, CORS
- WebSocket endpoint for streaming AI responses

**Integration Requirements:**
- **AI API:** OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo/GPT-4o or Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet for conversation
- Function calling / tool use for structured flow creation from natural language
- Conversation memory management (store full history, send recent context to AI)
- WebSocket support for streaming AI responses (better UX than polling)
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) as fallback for streaming if WebSocket unavailable

**Security/Compliance:**
- **Authentication via Logto** (OAuth 2.1, OIDC standards)
- JWT token verification on backend protected routes
- HTTPS everywhere in production
- Input sanitization and validation at API layer (Pydantic v2 validators)
- Rate limiting on AI endpoints to prevent abuse (slowapi or similar)
- CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication
- No storage of passwords (delegated to Logto)
- Minimal sensitive user data storage (GDPR-friendly)
- Environment-based secrets management (Logto credentials, API keys never committed)

---

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **User Adoption Risk:** Users may not immediately understand the "contexts" paradigm and default to treating it as a traditional TODO app with categories. **Impact: High. Mitigation: Strong onboarding experience, clear value proposition messaging, and guided first-time-user flow.**

- **AI Conversation Quality:** The AI may fail to correctly extract flows from natural language, leading to frustration. Users might get nonsensical suggestions or miss critical information. **Impact: High. Mitigation: Extensive prompt engineering, few-shot examples in system prompts, fallback to manual flow creation, continuous testing with diverse inputs.**

- **Mock Data Feels Too Fake:** Generated calendar/email data might be obviously artificial, undermining the demo of transition intelligence. **Impact: Medium. Mitigation: Invest time in realistic data generation with varied scenarios, use personas for consistency, show authentic-looking timestamps and names.**

- **Latest Tech Stack Instability:** Next.js 15, React 19, and Bun are cutting-edge; unexpected bugs could block progress. **Impact: Medium. Mitigation: Monitor GitHub issues, have rollback plan to stable versions (Next.js 14, React 18), allocate time for troubleshooting, leverage active community support.**

- **AI API Costs Exceed Budget:** Unmonitored AI usage during development/testing could quickly consume free credits or incur unexpected charges. **Impact: Low-Medium. Mitigation: Set up usage alerts, implement request caching, use shorter conversation context windows, test with smaller models initially.**

- **Scope Creep:** Temptation to add "just one more feature" delays MVP completion. **Impact: Medium. Mitigation: Strict adherence to MVP scope, park ideas in "Phase 2" backlog, regular progress check-ins against timeline.**

- **Transition Prompt Fatigue:** Users may find AI prompts at every context switch annoying rather than helpful. **Impact: Medium. Mitigation: Make prompts brief (1-2 sentences), allow "skip" option, learn when to be quiet vs. proactive, A/B test prompt frequency.**

- **Logto Service Dependency:** If Logto experiences downtime or changes pricing/terms, authentication could be blocked. **Impact: Low. Mitigation: Logto is SOC 2 certified with high uptime; worst case, pivot to custom JWT auth (2-3 day delay).**

- **Course Requirements Misalignment:** Instructor may not accept context-switching approach as satisfying "TODO app with tasks and labels" requirement. **Impact: High. Mitigation: Clarify with instructor early, emphasize that flows = tasks and contexts = labels under the hood, prepare technical documentation showing database schema alignment.**

---

### Open Questions

- **Which AI provider: OpenAI or Claude?** GPT-4 has better function calling support; Claude 3.5 Sonnet has better instruction following and context understanding. Need to benchmark both for flow extraction accuracy and conversation quality.

- **How many flows should be created during onboarding?** Too few = sparse experience; too many = overwhelming. Need to test 2-3 flows per context vs. 4-5 vs. letting users create their own organically.

- **Should completed flows auto-hide or stay visible for X hours?** User preference or smart default? Testing needed to understand what gives best "sense of progress" without clutter.

- **What's the right conversation memory window?** Full history = better personalization but higher AI costs and slower responses. Last 10 messages? Last 24 hours? Need performance testing.

- **How do we handle cross-context items?** If user mentions "call dentist" during Work Flow, should AI immediately create it in Personal Flow, ask first, or just note it for later?

- **What triggers a transition prompt?** Manual context switch only, or also time-based (e.g., 2+ hours in one context)? Need to balance helpfulness vs. intrusiveness.

- **How realistic should mock data be?** Generic placeholders vs. persona-driven scenarios? More realism = better demo but more upfront work.

- **Should we support dark mode from day one?** Nice-to-have for demo polish but adds development time. Worth it or defer to Phase 2?

- **What's the fallback if AI fails?** Should users have a manual "Create Flow" button always visible, or hidden unless AI struggles? Need UX testing.

---

### Areas Needing Further Research

- **AI Prompt Engineering Best Practices:** Study OpenAI/Claude documentation on function calling, structured outputs, and conversation memory management. Research conversational AI UX patterns from products like Notion AI, ChatGPT, Claude.

- **Context-Switching Psychology:** Review research on cognitive load, context switching costs, and transition design. Understand what makes transitions feel smooth vs. jarring.

- **Productivity App User Behavior:** Analyze retention and engagement patterns from Todoist, Sunsama, Motion. What causes users to abandon productivity tools? How do successful apps maintain long-term engagement?

- **WebSocket vs. SSE for AI Streaming:** Compare implementation complexity, browser support, and performance. Determine if WebSocket is worth the added infrastructure or if SSE is sufficient.

- **Bun Production Readiness:** Research real-world production deployments using Bun. Identify known issues, deployment platform support, and community consensus on stability.

- **Logto Integration Patterns:** Review Logto documentation for Next.js 15 App Router and FastAPI. Identify any gotchas or best practices for token validation and session management.

- **MongoDB Schema Design for Conversations:** How to efficiently store and query conversation history? Embedded documents vs. separate collection? Indexing strategies for fast retrieval.

- **AI Cost Optimization:** Research techniques for reducing API costs: prompt compression, caching strategies, using cheaper models for simple tasks, user-side rate limiting.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Validate Course Requirements with Instructor** - Schedule office hours to confirm that "flows + contexts" satisfies "tasks + labels" requirement. Show database schema alignment. Get explicit approval or guidance. **(Priority: Critical, Timeline: Week 1, Owner: You)**

2. **Choose AI Provider (OpenAI vs. Claude)** - Set up trial accounts for both. Create test prompts for flow extraction from natural language. Benchmark response quality, latency, and cost. Make final decision. **(Priority: High, Timeline: Week 1, Owner: You)**

3. **Set Up Development Environment** - Initialize `/my_flow_api` (FastAPI + Poetry/uv) and `/my_flow_client` (Next.js 15 + Bun) repositories. Configure MongoDB Atlas free tier. Set up Logto account and test app. Verify all services work locally. **(Priority: High, Timeline: Week 1, Owner: You)**

4. **Create Technical Architecture Document** - Detail API endpoints, data models (MongoDB schemas), authentication flow (Logto integration), and AI conversation architecture. Serves as development blueprint. **(Priority: High, Timeline: Week 1-2, Owner: You)**

5. **Design Low-Fidelity Wireframes** - Sketch main screens: login, context switcher, context view with flows, AI chat interface, transition prompts. Focus on user flow, not visual polish. **(Priority: Medium, Timeline: Week 1-2, Owner: You)**

6. **Implement Mock Data Generator** - Write Python script to generate realistic fake calendar events, emails, and pending items. Create 3-4 personas with consistent data patterns. Store templates in MongoDB on user signup. **(Priority: Medium, Timeline: Week 2, Owner: You)**

7. **Build Authentication Flow with Logto** - Integrate Logto SDKs in both frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI). Implement protected routes, token verification, user profile sync. Test sign-up, login, logout flows. **(Priority: High, Timeline: Week 2-3, Owner: You)**

8. **Develop Core Backend API** - Build REST endpoints for contexts, flows, and conversations. Implement CRUD operations with MongoDB. Set up Pydantic models and validation. Write basic API tests. **(Priority: Critical, Timeline: Week 3-4, Owner: You)**

9. **Build AI Conversation Service** - Create AI abstraction layer with prompt templates for flow extraction, transition facilitation, and contextual suggestions. Implement conversation memory management. Test with diverse user inputs. **(Priority: Critical, Timeline: Week 3-5, Owner: You)**

10. **Develop Frontend Core UI** - Build context switcher, context view with flow list (3-5 items), and AI chat interface. Implement real-time WebSocket connection for AI streaming. Connect to backend APIs with TanStack Query. **(Priority: Critical, Timeline: Week 4-6, Owner: You)**

11. **Implement Transition Moments** - Code AI prompts for entering/exiting contexts. Design UI for transition screens. Test various prompt styles for helpfulness vs. intrusiveness. **(Priority: High, Timeline: Week 5-6, Owner: You)**

12. **User Testing Round 1 (Alpha)** - Recruit 3-5 beta testers (friends, classmates). Observe first-time usage. Collect feedback on context paradigm understanding, AI conversation quality, and transition prompts. **(Priority: High, Timeline: Week 6-7, Owner: You)**

13. **Iterate Based on Feedback** - Address critical usability issues. Refine AI prompts. Adjust transition prompt frequency. Improve onboarding flow if users don't "get it" initially. **(Priority: High, Timeline: Week 7-8, Owner: You)**

14. **Polish UI/UX** - Apply Tailwind styling, ensure responsive design, add loading states and error handling. Make AI chat feel smooth and natural. Add subtle animations for context switching. **(Priority: Medium, Timeline: Week 8, Owner: You)**

15. **Deploy to Production** - Deploy backend to Railway/Render, frontend to Vercel, configure production MongoDB Atlas. Set up environment variables and secrets. Test end-to-end in production. **(Priority: High, Timeline: Week 9, Owner: You)**

16. **Create Demo Video & Documentation** - Record 3-5 minute demo showing key features and differentiators. Write README with setup instructions. Prepare presentation slides for course submission. **(Priority: High, Timeline: Week 9-10, Owner: You)**

17. **Final Testing & Bug Fixes** - Conduct thorough testing across browsers. Fix remaining bugs. Optimize performance. Ensure demo scenarios work flawlessly. **(Priority: High, Timeline: Week 10, Owner: You)**

18. **Submit Project** - Submit all deliverables per course requirements. Present demo to class if required. **(Priority: Critical, Timeline: Week 11-12, Owner: You)**

### PM Handoff

This **Project Brief** provides the full context for **My Flow**—an AI-powered context-switching companion that reimagines productivity through intentional transitions.

**For Product Managers / Next Phase:**

When moving from this brief to detailed product requirements (PRD):

1. **Review this brief thoroughly** to understand the strategic vision, target users, and key differentiators
2. **Start in PRD Generation Mode** - work section by section to translate this high-level brief into detailed specifications
3. **Focus areas for PRD development:**
   - Detailed user stories and acceptance criteria for each MVP feature
   - Comprehensive AI prompt library with examples
   - Complete API endpoint specifications with request/response schemas
   - Detailed UI component specifications with interaction patterns
   - Testing criteria and quality assurance procedures
   - Deployment and DevOps procedures

4. **Key questions to resolve during PRD creation:**
   - Exact AI prompt templates for all conversation scenarios
   - Specific rules for when AI should create flows vs. ask clarifying questions
   - Precise UX for transition moments (timing, dismissibility, frequency)
   - Detailed onboarding flow with screen-by-screen specifications
   - Error handling and edge case behaviors

5. **Maintain the vision:** The magic of My Flow is in the transitions, not the task management. Keep focus on helping users be intentional, not on building yet another feature-rich TODO app.

**This brief is your north star. Let's build something people actually want to use.** 🚀
