# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable users to seamlessly switch between different life contexts (work, personal, rest, social) without losing track of open tasks and conversations
- Provide AI-powered assistance to extract actionable flows from natural conversation
- Reduce cognitive load during context switching by preserving flow state
- Create a single source of truth for context-specific tasks, conversations, and progress
- Support rapid context transitions with minimal friction

## Background Context

My Flow addresses the modern challenge of frequent context switching across multiple life domains. Research shows that context switching imposes significant cognitive costs, yet remains unavoidable in daily life. Current productivity tools treat each context in isolation, forcing users to manually recreate their mental state when switching between work projects, personal tasks, family responsibilities, and leisure activities.

This application leverages conversational AI to make context switching natural and effortless. Instead of forcing users to manually organize tasks into rigid structures, My Flow allows users to simply talk through what they need to do, automatically extracting actionable "flows" (task sequences) and maintaining continuity across context switches. The MVP focuses on core context management, AI-powered flow extraction, and intelligent transition support.
