    monitor:
      - "Tests use mocks instead of real MongoDB (acceptable for repository layer unit tests)"
      - "FlowStatus and FlowWithStatus models defined but unused (forward-looking design)"
      - "Empty update edge case returns current document (correct behavior but worth monitoring)"

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "User ownership checks on all operations. Context validation prevents orphaned flows."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Configurable MAX_FLOWS_PER_CONTEXT limit. Proper use of MongoDB indexes (context_id, compound index on context_id+is_completed+priority)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with None/False returns. Idempotent mark_complete operation."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization, clear docstrings, type hints throughout. Follows BaseRepository pattern."
