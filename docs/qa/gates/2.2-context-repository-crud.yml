# Story 2.2: Context Repository with CRUD Operations (BE)

schema: 1
story: "2.2"
story_title: "Context Repository with CRUD Operations (BE)"
gate: "PASS"
status_reason: "Excellent implementation with comprehensive test coverage (91.58%). Both previous issues resolved: (1) unused exceptions removed and None/False strategy documented, (2) 100-item limit now configurable via settings.MAX_CONTEXTS_PER_USER. All acceptance criteria met."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Tests use mocked MongoDB instead of real integration tests against test database"
    suggested_action: "ACKNOWLEDGED: Will be addressed when Docker implementation is added. Mocking is acceptable for local development without Docker."

  - id: "CODE-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Custom exceptions (DocumentNotFoundError, UnauthorizedAccessError) defined but never raised in repository code"
    suggested_action: "Repository methods return None for not-found/unauthorized cases instead of raising exceptions. Either use these exceptions consistently or remove them if returning None is the desired pattern."
    refs: ["my_flow_api/src/repositories/exceptions.py", "my_flow_api/src/repositories/context_repository.py:44-140"]
    suggested_owner: dev
    status: resolved
    resolution: "Removed unused exception classes. Documented None/False return strategy in exceptions.py docstring. Repository layer focuses on data access while service layer handles business logic and HTTP responses."

  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Hardcoded length limit (100) in get_all_by_user() query"
    suggested_action: "Make the limit configurable or add pagination support for users with >100 contexts"
    refs: ["my_flow_api/src/repositories/context_repository.py:79"]
    suggested_owner: dev
    status: resolved
    resolution: "Added MAX_CONTEXTS_PER_USER setting to config.py (default: 100). Updated get_all_by_user() to use settings.MAX_CONTEXTS_PER_USER instead of hardcoded value."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper user ownership checks in all operations (user_id filtering). ObjectId conversion is safely handled with try/except for InvalidId."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Configurable limit via settings.MAX_CONTEXTS_PER_USER. Proper MongoDB indexes for user_id and (user_id, created_at desc)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful handling of invalid ObjectIds, proper async/await patterns, timezone-aware timestamps using datetime.now(UTC)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean repository pattern, good separation of concerns, comprehensive docstrings, strong type hints (Python 3.12+ union syntax)."

# Requirements Traceability Matrix
requirements_trace:
  ac_1_repository_class:
    status: COVERED
    tests:
      - "Given a ContextRepository instance, When initialized with database, Then it has all required CRUD methods (create, get_by_id, get_all_by_user, update, delete)"
      - "Given repository methods, When called, Then they are async and use Motor async driver"
    coverage: "base.py:64%, context_repository.py:97%"

    status: COVERED
    tests:
      - "Given create() method, When context created, Then returns ContextInDB with ID and timestamps"
      - "Given get_by_id() method, When context exists, Then returns ContextInDB or None"
      - "Given get_all_by_user() method, When user has contexts, Then returns List[ContextInDB]"
      - "Given update() method, When context updated, Then returns updated ContextInDB or None"

      - "Given user_id mismatch, When accessing context, Then returns None (ownership check)"
    notes: "None/False return strategy documented. RepositoryError base class available for future database connection errors."

  ac_4_integration_tests:
    status: COVERED
    tests:

      - "Coverage: 91.58% overall, 97% for context_repository.py (exceeds 85% requirement)"
    notes: "Tests use mocks (acknowledged as acceptable until Docker). All tests pass successfully."
