# Quality Gate Decision
# Story 2.2: Context Repository with CRUD Operations (BE)

schema: 1
story: "2.2"
story_title: "Context Repository with CRUD Operations (BE)"
gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "Solid implementation with good test coverage (97%). Two issues require attention: (1) custom exceptions defined but never used, (2) hardcoded 100-item limit without pagination. Mocked tests acknowledged as temporary until Docker implementation."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

    suggested_action: "Repository methods return None for not-found/unauthorized cases instead of raising exceptions. Either use these exceptions consistently or remove them if returning None is the desired pattern."

    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper user ownership checks in all operations (user_id filtering). ObjectId conversion is safely handled with try/except for InvalidId."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Hardcoded 100 item limit without pagination. No indexes verified in code (mentioned in AC4 for database.py but not reviewed here)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful handling of invalid ObjectIds, proper async/await patterns, timezone-aware timestamps using UTC."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean repository pattern, good separation of concerns, comprehensive docstrings, strong type hints."

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Clarify exception strategy: either use custom exceptions (DocumentNotFoundError, UnauthorizedAccessError) consistently throughout repository methods, or remove them and document that None/False returns are the intentional pattern"
      refs: ["my_flow_api/src/repositories/exceptions.py", "my_flow_api/src/repositories/context_repository.py"]
    - action: "Add pagination support to get_all_by_user() or make the 100-item limit configurable via settings/parameter"
      refs: ["my_flow_api/src/repositories/context_repository.py:66-80"]
  future:
    - action: "Replace mocked integration tests with real MongoDB integration tests when Docker implementation is added"

    status: COVERED
    tests:
      - "Given a ContextRepository instance, When initialized with database, Then it has all required CRUD methods (create, get_by_id, get_all_by_user, update, delete)"
      - "Given repository methods, When called, Then they are async and use Motor async driver"
    coverage: "base.py:64%, context_repository.py:97%"

    status: COVERED
    tests:

      - "Given user_id mismatch, When accessing context, Then returns None (ownership check)"
    notes: "Custom exceptions defined but not used. Returns None instead of raising DocumentNotFoundError/UnauthorizedAccessError."

  ac_4_integration_tests:

    notes: "Tests use mocks instead of real MongoDB. Cleanup fixtures present but not functional against real DB."
