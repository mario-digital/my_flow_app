# Additional context
notes: |
  This is a foundational story that establishes the Pydantic models for the entire application.
  The implementation demonstrates textbook-quality code:

  - Proper Pydantic v2 patterns (ConfigDict, field_serializer, field_validator)
  - Python Enum classes per coding standards Section 9
  - Critical timezone validation to prevent data corruption
  - Comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage (exceeds 80% requirement)
  - MongoDB index documentation for future database optimization
  - Clean architecture with appropriate separation of concerns

  No refactoring was performed as the code quality is already exceptional.
  The implementation is production-ready and sets an excellent standard for subsequent stories.

  Key innovation: @field_validator('due_date') enforces timezone-aware datetimes,
  preventing a common source of production bugs in datetime-heavy applications.
