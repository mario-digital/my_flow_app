  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No vulnerabilities. User-supplied colors safely rendered via inline styles. React auto-escapes text content."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient rendering. Sorting O(n log n) acceptable for expected dataset (<100 contexts). No bottlenecks detected."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful error handling. Safe optional chaining for missing context. TypeScript types prevent invalid props."
  maintainability:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: "Self-documenting code. Comprehensive Dev Notes. Excellent test coverage. Clear separation of concerns."
  accessibility:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: "WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant. Zero violations (jest-axe). Full keyboard navigation. Proper ARIA attributes."
