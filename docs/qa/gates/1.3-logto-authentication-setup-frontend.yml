# Quality Gate Decision: Story 1.3
schema: 1
story: "1.3"
story_title: "Logto Authentication Setup (Frontend)"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent implementation with comprehensive tests (33 passing), but vault name inconsistency and missing Navigation component tests need addressing before production."

top_issues:
  - id: "CFG-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Vault name mismatch: Story AC2 specifies 'MyFlow Development' but .env.template uses 'my_flow_secrets'"
    suggested_action: "Align vault naming: Update .env.template to use 'MyFlow Development' as specified in AC2, or update story documentation to reflect actual vault name"

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Navigation component has no unit tests despite being critical for auth UX (shows sign-in/sign-out state)"
    suggested_action: "Add unit tests for Navigation component covering authenticated and unauthenticated states"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "E2E tests don't verify actual OAuth sign-in flow, only navigation and redirects"
    suggested_action: "Note for future: Consider adding E2E tests with Logto test account for full OAuth flow (acceptable for MVP)"
