# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ ALL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS MET:
      - JWT validation with JWKS caching (thread-safe with RLock)
      - HTTPS enforcement in production
      - CORS properly configured (no wildcards)
      - Pagination limits prevent DoS (max offset=10000, max limit=100)
      - Authorization helpers centralize ownership checks
      - ✅ RATE LIMITING IMPLEMENTED:
        - slowapi ^0.1.9 installed
        - Limiter configured in main.py
        - All endpoints protected with appropriate limits
        - 429 responses with Retry-After headers
        - RateLimitError model documented in OpenAPI

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - ✅ 8 database indexes created (compound index for paginated queries)
      - ✅ Bulk cascade delete (delete_many) avoids N+1 problem
      - ✅ Pagination with default limit=50, max=100
      - ✅ JWKS caching with 1-hour TTL reduces auth overhead

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - ✅ Proper error handling with HTTPException
      - ✅ JWKS stale cache fallback on fetch failures
      - ✅ Health check endpoint with MongoDB ping
      - ✅ Database connection lifecycle managed in lifespan
      - ✅ Rate limiting protects against abuse

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - ✅ DRY authorization helpers reduce duplication
      - ✅ Clean dependency injection pattern
      - ✅ Type hints throughout (minor mypy warnings non-blocking)
      - ✅ 96% router test coverage provides safety net
      - ✅ API documentation enables easy testing and onboarding
