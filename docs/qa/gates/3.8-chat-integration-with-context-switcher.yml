nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "BFF proxy pattern correctly implemented - JWT tokens stay server-side only, no direct FastAPI calls from browser"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "TanStack Query caching with 5-min stale time and 10-min cache provides optimal context switching performance. Matches <200ms target"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling in API route and hook. Loading states handled gracefully. Context switch detection works correctly"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization, comprehensive TypeScript types, good separation of concerns, proper use of design tokens"

code_quality_highlights:
  - "Exemplary BFF proxy implementation with proper JWT handling"
  - "Clean React hook design with proper dependency arrays"
  - "Excellent use of useMemo and useRef for performance"
  - "Comprehensive TypeScript types with proper interfaces"
  - "Semantic design tokens used correctly (h-skeleton-*, w-skeleton-*)"
  - "Well-structured integration tests (8 test cases, 100% pass rate)"
  - "All 253 tests pass in 5.13s"
