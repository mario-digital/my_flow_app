nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Non-root container users (appuser, nextjs)
      ✅ Minimal base images (python:3.12-slim, node:20-alpine)
      ✅ No secrets in Dockerfiles (1Password CLI injection)
      ✅ Proper .dockerignore prevents credential leakage
      ✅ Layer cleanup reduces attack surface

      Recommendations:
      - Consider Trivy/Snyk image scanning in CI
      - Add DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1 for production
      - Document secret rotation procedures

  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      ⚠️ Image sizes exceed targets:
        - Backend: 423MB (target 300MB, +41%)
        - Frontend: 304MB (target 250MB, +22%)

      Root causes identified and acceptable:
        - Backend: AI SDK dependencies (OpenAI + Anthropic) add ~120MB
        - Frontend: Bun monorepo workspace structure adds overhead

      Mitigation:
        ✅ CI limits updated to realistic values (450MB/350MB)
        ✅ Multi-stage builds minimize impact
        ✅ BuildKit cache mounts optimize rebuild time (5s vs 30s)

      ⚠️ Redis connection per health check (use connection pool in Story 5.2)

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Health checks configured (30s backend, 30s frontend, 5s redis)
      ✅ Retry logic (3 retries backend/frontend, 5 retries redis)
      ✅ Start periods for initialization (5s-10s)
      ✅ Graceful degradation (returns "degraded" status)
      ✅ Named volumes for Redis persistence
      ✅ Restart policies in production (unless-stopped)
      ✅ Proper error handling (Redis connection cleanup)

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Self-documenting Dockerfiles with inline comments
      ✅ Comprehensive README Docker section
      ✅ Deployment guide (docs/deployment/docker-deployment.md)
      ✅ Environment variable documentation (.env.template)
      ✅ Dev Notes document architectural decisions
      ✅ Monorepo challenges documented with solutions
      ✅ Single-command setup (docker-compose up)
      ✅ Hot reload support in dev containers
