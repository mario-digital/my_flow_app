# Additional Context
notes: |
  This is an exceptionally well-implemented story with excellent code quality.
  All issues identified in the initial review have been resolved.
  
  RESOLVED: Integration tests were relocated from tests/integration/ to 
  tests/integration/routers/ directory. All 3 integration tests now pass.
  
  The implementation is production-ready with 100% unit test coverage and 
  comprehensive integration tests. All acceptance criteria met with excellent
  code quality, security, performance, and maintainability.
  
  Status: READY FOR DONE
