# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Authentication properly enforced. User isolation implemented correctly via user_id filtering."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient queries using include_completed=False filter. Minimal processing overhead. Flow sorting is O(n log n) which is acceptable for expected data volumes."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling. All edge cases covered by tests (no flows, completed flows, missing due dates, timezone handling)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure with excellent separation of concerns. Comprehensive docstrings on all methods. 100% test coverage ensures refactoring safety."
