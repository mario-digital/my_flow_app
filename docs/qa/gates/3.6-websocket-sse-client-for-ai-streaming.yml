  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent security posture. SSE via BFF pattern keeps JWT tokens server-side (never exposed to browser). Superior to direct WebSocket approach.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Refactored sendMessage to avoid unnecessary recreations. Clean state management. Meets <500ms perceived latency via optimistic UI updates.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with exponential backoff reconnection (3 retries). Graceful degradation on connection failures.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean code with excellent documentation. Type-safe with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces. 90.69% test coverage exceeds 80% requirement.'
