# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "JWT validation follows OWASP best practices. RS256 algorithm enforcement, complete claim validation (iss/aud/exp/sub), key rotation support, no credential leakage."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "JWKS caching with @lru_cache, 5s timeout, async-compatible design. No performance bottlenecks."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for 8+ failure scenarios. Graceful degradation on JWKS fetch failure (503/502 errors)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear docstrings, type hints, 90% test coverage, well-organized code structure. Production-ready."
