# Quality Gate Decision - Story 3.1
schema: 1
story: "3.1"
story_title: "OpenAI/Anthropic SDK Integration & Streaming Service"
gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "Implementation is architecturally sound with passing linters/type-checkers, but 10/18 unit tests fail due to async mock configuration issues, and coverage is 53% vs 80% target."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

    severity: high
    finding: "10 out of 18 unit tests failing due to improper async mock setup for OpenAI/Anthropic SDK streams"

    severity: high
    finding: "Test coverage at 53% overall (72% for ai_service.py) vs 80% acceptance criteria requirement"
    suggested_action: "Fix failing tests to achieve accurate coverage measurement and add missing test scenarios"

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Fix async mock configuration in test suite to enable proper coverage measurement"
      - "Resolve all 10 failing unit tests before considering story complete"
    monitor:
      - "Monitor actual API integration when Task 14 (manual 1Password testing) is completed"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API keys properly managed via settings, no hardcoded secrets, proper error wrapping prevents leakage"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Async streaming implementation appropriate, logging does not block streams"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Error handling is well-designed but untested due to failing test suite"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code quality excellent - proper type hints, docstrings, import order, passes ruff and mypy"

quality_score: 60  # 100 - (20 × 0 FAILs) - (10 × 4 CONCERNS) = 60
