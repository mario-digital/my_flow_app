story_title: "Flow List UI Component (FE)"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent Flow component implementation (96.71% coverage, 24 tests), but project-wide function coverage at 77.5% fails 80% threshold. Developer must fix coverage config or add missing tests before merging."

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Update vitest.config.ts to exclude barrel exports from coverage"
      details: |
        Add to exclude array in vitest.config.ts:
        ```typescript
        exclude: [
          '**/*.test.{ts,tsx}',
          '**/test-setup.tsx',
          '**/*.config.{ts,js,mjs}',
          '**/types/**',
          '**/components/ui/**',
          '**/index.ts',  // ADD THIS - barrel exports shouldn't count toward coverage
        ]
        ```
      refs: ["my_flow_client/vitest.config.ts:24-30"]

    - action: "OR add test for use-context-theme hook to improve function coverage"
      details: "Create src/hooks/__tests__/use-context-theme.test.tsx with renderHook tests"
      refs: ["src/hooks/use-context-theme.ts"]

implementation_highlights:
  story_2_6_strengths:
    - "✓ Perfect UX design system compliance (Sally's Flow Card spec)"
    - "✓ Reusable FlowCard component architecture"
    - "✓ 100% coverage on FlowList component"
    - "✓ Semantic colors for priority badges (error/warning/success)"
    - "✓ Comprehensive test coverage (24 tests, 96.71% for flow components)"
    - "✓ TypeScript Flow interface matches backend model"
    - "✓ Helper functions well-tested (getPriorityBadgeClasses, truncateDescription, formatDate)"
    - "✓ Loading and empty states implemented"
    - "✓ Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation on FlowCard)"
    - "✓ Zero hardcoded values - all design tokens via Tailwind"
    - "✓ Flow Card tokens added to globals.css"
    - "✓ Clean barrel exports via index.ts"
    - "✓ Proper event propagation (stopPropagation on checkbox/dropdown)"

  areas_needing_attention:
    - "❌ Project-wide function coverage below 80% threshold (77.5%)"
    - "⚠️  Coverage includes barrel exports (index.ts) which shouldn't count"
    - "⚠️  Unused hook (use-context-theme) not tested, dragging down metrics"
    - "⚠️  React act() warning in unrelated test (Story 2.5)"
