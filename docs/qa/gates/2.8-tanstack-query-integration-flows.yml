    notes: "Authentication enforced via useCurrentUser() guards. Server actions handle JWT injection. No sensitive data exposure."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimistic updates achieve <500ms perceived latency. Appropriate cache configuration (staleTime: 2min, gcTime: 5min for lists). Mutation keys prevent duplicate submissions."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with rollback on all mutations. Race condition prevention via cancelQueries. All edge cases tested."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation (JSDoc on all functions). Clean code organization. Centralized messages for i18n. Generated types from OpenAPI."

# Review notes
notes: |
  EXEMPLARY IMPLEMENTATION - This story demonstrates best-in-class TanStack Query integration.

  Key achievements:
  - Perfect test coverage (13/13 tests passing, all paths validated)
  - Zero ESLint errors/warnings with strict type safety
  - Comprehensive requirements traceability (all 8 ACs mapped to tests)
  - Outstanding documentation (JSDoc on every function with examples)
  - Proper cache invalidation preventing race conditions
  - Robust error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Zero technical debt introduced

  This implementation should serve as a reference for future TanStack Query integrations.
  The developer has created production-ready code that exemplifies our architectural standards.

  Architecture review highlights:
  - Clean separation of concerns (API client → Hooks → Components)
  - Proper optimistic update patterns with rollback
  - Centralized error handling via transformError()
  - Message constants ready for i18n
  - Generated OpenAPI types (single source of truth)

  No refactoring or fixes required. Ready for production deployment.
