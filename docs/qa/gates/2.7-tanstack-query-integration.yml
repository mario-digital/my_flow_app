nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Authentication via Logto server actions, CSRF protected, error messages sanitized, no credential exposure"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimistic updates <500ms latency, proper cache configuration (staleTime 5min, gcTime 10min/2min), cancelQueries prevents races"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with rollback, 93.15% hook coverage, 100% API client coverage, all edge cases tested"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent JSDoc coverage, consistent patterns, centralized messages for i18n, hierarchical keys enable surgical invalidation"

# Detailed test coverage

  patterns_used:
    - "Hierarchical query/mutation keys (TanStack Query best practice)"
    - "Optimistic updates with rollback"
    - "Server action pattern for auth"
    - "OpenAPI type generation (single source of truth)"
    - "MSW for API mocking in tests"
  code_organization: "Excellent - proper separation (api/, hooks/, mocks/, providers/)"
  type_safety: "Excellent - direct OpenAPI consumption prevents drift"
  error_handling: "Excellent - consistent transformError + toast pattern"
